# Emotion Recognition using image processing

Without the use of any Machine learning algorithms/Deep Neural Networks, we are planning to implement heuristic image process technique for detecting emotions from an images. It will be our attempt to research if its even possible to do so.

## Project Overview

The Facial Emotion Recognition Faces Dataset is a valuable resource for researchers and machine learning practitioners interested in studying and developing models for emotion recognition and analysis. The dataset comprises images capturing individuals exhibiting seven distinct emotions: anger, contempt, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise. Each image is meticulously labeled to denote the specific emotion being expressed, facilitating precise analysis and model training.

## Dataset Details

- **Emotions:** The dataset covers a broad spectrum of human emotions, providing a rich source of data for emotion recognition research.
- **Diversity:** Encompassing individuals from various genders, ethnicities, and age groups, the dataset offers a diverse representation of human expressions.
- **Applications:** With its comprehensive coverage of emotions and diverse subject demographics, the dataset finds applications in various fields, including:
  - Automatic emotion detection systems
  - Mental health analysis and assessment
  - Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision
  - Integration into entertainment industries for enhanced user experiences
  - Utilization in advertising and market research for targeted audience analysis
  - Implementation in security and surveillance systems for behavior analysis and anomaly detection.
